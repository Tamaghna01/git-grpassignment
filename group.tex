        \item \(\mu^{2004}\)
        \item \(\pi_{2004}\)
        \item \(2004^{\alpha}\)
        \item \(2004_m\)
        \item \(\tau_{2004}\)
        \item \(\log_{2004}\)
        \item \(\ln 2004\)
        \item \(0 < x \leq 2004\)
        \item \(\sum_{i=1}^{2004} x_i\)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Roots, fractions, and displaystyle
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\sqrt{2004}\)
        \item \(\sqrt[3]{2004}\)
        \item \(\frac{2004}{2}\)
        \item \(\frac{\sqrt{2004}}{2}\)
        \item \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2004}}\)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Delimiters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\left( \frac{2004}{2} \right)\)
        \item \(\left[ \frac{2004}{2} \right]\)
        \item \(\left\{ \frac{2004}{2} \right\}\)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Tables and Continuous Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \(\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3} = ?\)
    \item[(b)] \(\lim_{x \to -2} \frac{x^2 + x - 6}{x + 2} = ?\)
    \item[(c)] \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(3+h)^2 - 9}{h} = ?\)
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Functions \& Formulas}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \(f(x) = x^3 - x\)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[i.] \(f'(x) = ?\)
        \item[ii.] \(f''(x) = ?\)
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I}
If \(F\) is an antiderivative for \(f\) on an interval \(I\), then for every continuous function on \(I\),
\[ \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = F(b) - F(a). \]

\section*{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II}
If \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\), then the function defined by
\[ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt \]
for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and differentiable on \((a,b)\), and \(F'(x) = f(x)\).

\section*{Example}
Method vs use of F.T.C., part 2 in the step-by-step solution.
\[ \int_0^{1972} \frac{dx}{1+x^2} = [\arctan x]_0^{1972} = \ldots \]

\section*{Taylor Series}
Convergent geometric series since \(|r| < 1\).
\[ e^{-t/12} \sin t = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{t^{n+1}}{(12)^n (n+1)!} \]

\section{Git Branching and Merging}
\subsection*{Date: 08-09-2024}
\title{Git Branching and Merging{} Document}
Assignment: Git Branching and Merging

Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

Task step by step:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called "git-advanced".
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch called "feature-1" and switch to it.
4. Create a new file called "shared.txt" and add the following text:

This is a shared file.
Line 1: Original text.
Line 2: Original text.

5. Stage and commit the file with a meaningful message.
6. Push the branch to GitHub.
7. Create another branch called "feature-2" and switch to it.
8. Checkout the "shared.txt" file from the main branch (to ensure you're starting with the same file).
9. Modify the "shared.txt" file by changing the second line to:

Line 2: Modified text in feature-2.

10. Stage and commit the changes with a meaningful message.
11. Push the branch to GitHub.
12. Switch back to the "feature-1" branch.
13. Modify the "shared.txt" file by changing the second line to:

Line 2: Modified text in feature-1.

14. Stage and commit the changes with a meaningful message.
15. Push the branch to GitHub.
16. Merge "feature-1" into the main branch.
17. Merge "feature-2" into the main branch, which should introduce a conflict.
18. Resolve the conflict by editing the file and committing the resolution.
19. Push the updated main branch to GitHub.
20. Delete the "feature-1" and "feature-2" branches.

Deliverables:
You need to upload only ONE pdf file consists of the below things:
A screenshot of your GitHub repository showing the commit history and branching.
A screenshot of your local machine showing the Git log and conflict resolution.
A brief write-up of your experience with Git branching and merging.
Grading criteria:
Correct creation and management of branches.
Accurate merging and conflict resolution.
Clear and meaningful commit messages.
Proper deletion of branches.
